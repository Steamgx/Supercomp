Here is the comprehensive plan for running through the program:

### Plan:
1. **Start the CLI Program**: Execute the `cli.py` script to initiate the command-line interface.
2. **Test Each Functionality**:
   - **Create Client**: Select the option to create a client and input the required details (name, age, address).
   - **Create Product**: Select the option to create a product and input the required details (name, price).
   - **Create Order**: Select the option to create an order and input the required details (client ID, product ID, quantity, total).
   - **Get Clients**: Select the option to retrieve and display all clients.
   - **Get Products**: Select the option to retrieve and display all products.
   - **Get Orders**: Select the option to retrieve and display all orders.
   - **Get Client Orders**: Select the option to retrieve and display orders for a specific client by entering their client ID.
   - **Exit**: Select the exit option to terminate the program.

3. **Verify Outputs**: Ensure that the outputs for each operation are as expected and that the database (`Super.db`) reflects the changes made during the tests.
4.Plan:
Understanding the Project Structure:

The project consists of two main files: models.py and cli.py.
models.py defines the database schema using SQLAlchemy, including the Client, Product, and Order classes, along with functions to create and retrieve records.
cli.py provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the database, allowing them to create clients, products, and orders, as well as retrieve lists of these entities.
Enhancements and Modifications:

Add Input Validation: Implement input validation in cli.py to ensure that user inputs are valid (e.g., checking if IDs exist before creating orders).
Error Handling: Add error handling to manage exceptions that may arise during database operations (e.g., handling cases where a client or product ID does not exist).
User Experience Improvements: Enhance the user interface in cli.py to provide clearer instructions and feedback to the user.
Testing:

After implementing the enhancements, thoroughly test the CLI to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
Test edge cases, such as invalid inputs and database constraints.
Documentation:

Update or create documentation to explain how to use the CLI and the purpose of each function in models.py.
Follow-Up Steps:

Review the changes with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
Prepare for deployment or further development based on user feedback.
